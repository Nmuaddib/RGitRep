Hi!! I've been working with IT for the past 25 years, but R and statistics are subjects that I love working with, even though I mostly manage teams these days. I'm sending a couple of sample codes I have developed in the past, including a complete article, output from Rmarkdown with a regression as the main focus, and a PHD thesis analysis. Looking forward to meet you, hope we can work together.
